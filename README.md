# NODE TYPESCRIPT STARTER

## Features

### 1 . DB Connection with Sequelize

In this module we connect express with sequelize
https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/

In this project we use a Mysql DB, but sequelize also gives you possibility to connect to : 
- `Mariadb`
- `Postgres`
- `SQliteDB`
- `Microsoft SQL Server`
- `Oracle Database`	

The `docker-compose.yml` file, also is configured to connect the project on a MySQL Image, you should updated it, if you intend to use another DBMS


#### Note on usage of Typescript with Sequelize

The plugin used to combine typescript and sequelize is not the official of `sequelize.org`.
But as precised in the documentation, it still in work in progress. They recommand to use package `sequelize-typescript` 
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-typescript) until their improvements are ready to be released.

Please check the official page to be informed on a potential update (https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/typescript/)
